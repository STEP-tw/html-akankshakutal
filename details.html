      Pikachu is small, chubby, and incredibly cute mouse-like Pokemon. They are
      almost completely covered by yellow fur. They have long yellow ears that
      are tipped with black. A Pikachu's back has two brown stripes, and its
      large tail is notable for being shaped like a lightning bolt. On its
      cheeks are two circle-shaped red pouches used for storing electricity.
      They turn yellow and spark with electricity when its about to use an
      Electric attack, such as Thunderbolt. It has also been known to generate
      small surges of electrical energy in anger or for protection, like in the
      anime.

    <P>
      Celebi is small, angular Pokemon with short arms and stubby rounded feet.
      Its cranium is shaped similarly to a flower bulb, extended upward in a
      left stroke. Celebi's blue eyes are rather large, compensating most of its
      face. Also extending from its head are two small string-like antennae with
      blue tips. They seem to curl in a different direction most of the time.
      The larger space of its back is covered with two, white moth-like wings,
      short and small extending only halfway up its arm length. Celebi's head is
      similar to an onion.

    <p>
      Snorlax is a fat noseless Pokemon that has a cream-colored face, hands and
      feet, while the rest of its body is teal in color. Its head is also
      large,and it has two small canine teeth visibly protruding from its lower
      jaw.Its feet are large compared to most Pokemon, which assist its balance
      when it chooses to stand. Although Snorlax's arms are short in relation to
      its size, they are long enough to enable it to both grab food and eat.
      Snorlax has been said to weigh over 1,000 pounds, and for a time was
      considered the heaviest known Pokemon.Due to having an enormous appetite,
      Snorlax will devour almost anything, even moldy and rotten food.Thanks to
      its extremely strong digestive juices, Snorlax's stomach can dissolve any
      kind of poison. As a result, it can eat tainted food without worry.
