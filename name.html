      The name Pokemon is the romanized contraction of the Japanese brand Pocket
      Monsters.The term "Pokemon", in addition to referring to the Pokemon
      franchise itself, also collectively refers to the 809 fictional species
      that have made appearances in Pokemon media as of the release of the
      seventh generation titles Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!
      "Pokemon" is identical in the singular and plural, as is each individual
      species name; it is grammatically correct to say "one Pokemon" and "many
      Pokemon", as well as "one Pikachu" and "many Pikachu".
