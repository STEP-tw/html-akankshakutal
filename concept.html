    <h1>Concept</h1>
    <p style="width: 850px; display: inline-block">
      		Pokemon executive director Satoshi Tajiri first thought of Pokemon, albeit
      with a different concept and name, around 1989, when the Game Boy was
      released. The concept of the Pokemon universe, in both the video games and
      the general fictional world of Pokemon, stems from the hobby of insect
      collecting, a popular pastime which Tajiri enjoyed as a child.[29] Players
      are designated as Pokemon Trainers and have three general goals: to
      complete the regional Pokedex by collecting all of the available Pokemon
      species found in the fictional region where a game takes place, to
      complete the national Pokedex by transferring Pokemon from other regions,
      and to train a team of powerful Pokemon from those they have caught to
      compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may eventually win
      the Pokemon League and become the regional Champion. These themes of
      collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of
      the Pokemon franchise, including the video games, the anime and manga
      series, and the Pokemon Trading Card Game.

      		In most incarnations of the Pokemon universe, a Trainer who encounters a
      wild Pokemon is able to capture that Pokemon by throwing a specially
      designed, mass-producible spherical tool called a Poke Ball at it. If the
      Pokemon is unable to escape the confines of the Poke Ball, it is
      considered to be under the ownership of that Trainer. Afterwards, it will
      obey whatever commands it receives from its new Trainer, unless the
      Trainer demonstrates such a lack of experience that the Pokemon would
      rather act on its own accord. Trainers can send out any of their Pokemon
      to wage non-lethal battles against other Pokemon; if the opposing Pokemon
      is wild, the Trainer can capture that Pokemon with a Poke Ball, increasing
      their collection of creatures. In Pokemon Go, and in Pokemon: Let's Go,
      Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!, wild Pokemon encountered by players can be
      caught in Poke Balls, but generally cannot be battled. Pokemon already
      owned by other Trainers cannot be captured, except under special
      circumstances in certain side games. If a Pokemon fully defeats an
      opponent in battle so that the opponent is knocked out ("faints"), the
      winning Pokemon gains experience points and may level up. Beginning with
      Pokemon X and Y, experience points are also gained from catching Pokemon
      in Poke Balls. When leveling up, the Pokemon's battling aptitude
      statistics ("stats, such as Attack and Speed") increase. At certain
      levels, the Pokemon may also learn new moves, which are techniques used in
      battle. In addition, many species of Pokemon can undergo a form of
      metamorphosis and transform into a similar but stronger species of
      Pokemon, a process called evolution.</p>
      <p>
					In the main series, each game's single-player mode requires the Trainer to
			raise a team of Pokemon to defeat many non-player character (NPC) Trainers and their Pokemon. Each game lays out a somewhat linear path through a specific region of the Pokemon world for the Trainer to journey through, completing events and battling opponents along the way (including foiling the plans of an 'evil'
      team of Pokemon Trainers who serve as antagonists to the player).
      Excluding Pokemon Sun and Moon and Pokemon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, the
      games feature eight powerful Trainers, referred to as Gym Leaders, that
      the Trainer must defeat in order to progress. As a reward, the Trainer
      receives a Gym Badge, and once all eight badges are collected, the Trainer
      is eligible to challenge the region's Pokemon League, where four talented
      trainers (referred to collectively as the "Elite Four") challenge the
      Trainer to four Pokemon battles in succession. If the trainer can overcome
      this gauntlet, they must challenge the Regional Champion, the master
      Trainer who had previously defeated the Elite Four. Any Trainer who wins
      this last battle becomes the new champion.</p>
