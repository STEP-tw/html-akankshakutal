      List of Pokemon by National Pokedex number
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is a list of Pokemon in the order dictated by the National Pokedex,
      meaning that Pokemon from the Kanto region will appear first, followed by
      those from Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, and Alola. Each region's
      set of Pokemon starts with its own set of starter Pokemon and their
      evolutions, going in order of Grass, Fire, Water; the only exception is
      Unova, which begins with Victini, who is then followed by the starter
      Pokemon. The first 151 entries in this Pokedex also serve as Kanto's
      regional Pokedex. In Generation II, this Pokedex order was known as the
      "Old Pokedex", with a new order that put related Pokemon near each other
      also included.
